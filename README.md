##How Travel Mate Works

While travelling from one place to another, there are a lot of factors to be considered so as to make the trip a memorable one. Our product helps the traveller with anything and everything that he might need from the moment he plans the journey till the time he is back home happy and content.
The product includes a wide variety of options- from Selection of Mode of Transport to finding out about the place of visit to provision of Best music,novels depending on the mood of the traveller. The app basically works in 3 phases. 

##Phases
###1.Planning Phase
Before you finalize your trip, we give you options across the country. You can “virtually” explore the city through our app. Choose your destination city and get to know about many important things in the city. Be it anything : Fun Facts, Climate, Culture, Restaurants, Hangout Places, Monuments (if any), Shopping Complexes. The UI is kept fun and colorful to keep the user engaged in the app. Obviously, People like to travel with their F.R.I.E.N.D.S., so we have a share option, by which user can share the facts with the friend and invite him to join.

Next comes the mode of transit. Compare the bus, trains and car travel prices from the app itself. We have Comprehensive list of various modes of transit sorted in the decreasing order of their rating. For car, we let him know about the total toll taxes and the total cost of fuel he has to bear.

A very interesting feature that we plan to include in the product is - Push notification in between the journey. Often it happens that while travelling alone, a person tends to doze off. In order to save the traveller from missing out the destination station, we use the real time GPS location of the traveller to let him know about the city he is currently in or about to reach. We also plan to include an alarm notification which would go off when the traveller is around half an hour (calculated using the speed is travelling with) away from his destination so as to ensure the traveller doesn’t miss his destination. If interested, the traveller can take a little detour and explore this city as well. Just so that the traveller doesn’t get bored during his journey and to provide the maximum comfort possible, we provide the user with the best Music, Videos and stuff to read so that even if the person is travelling alone, he’s not practically alone. The Music, Videos and Reading material provided would depend on the tastes and the mood of the user which would be done using Mood Analysis with Machine Learning. For instance, if the user is feeling low, we can recommend him jokes or humorous videos. The UI of the app would also change according to user’s mood to make him comfortable.
While travelling, a person clicks a quite significant number of pictures. To make it easier for him to share these pictures on any of his social media accounts, we provide a feature that if he signs-in from his social media account and clicks a picture from our app, it will be directly uploaded on the respective account using some filters and along with some text.
We have tried to include solutions for every possible problem the traveller may face during the course of his entire journey.
