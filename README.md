#Travel Mate

A must-have app for all the travellers who are visiting a city for the first time. The app provides them with everything **from Planning to their Journey** and also from **from Journey to the destination**. The platform basically uses a [mash-up technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mashup_(web_application_hybrid)). We have tried to include solutions for every possible problem the traveller might face during the course of his entire journey.

##How Travel Mate Works

While travelling from one place to another, there are a lot of factors to be considered in order to make the trip a memorable one. Our platform helps the traveller with anything and everything that he might need from the moment he plans the journey till the time he is back home happy and content.
The platform includes a wide variety of options - from selection of Mode of Transport, to finding out about the destination city to provision of best music, novels depending on the mood of the traveller. Travel Mate basically works in 3 phases. 

##Phases
###1.Planning Phase
Before you start your trip, we give you options across the country. You can “virtually” explore the city through our app. Choose your destination city and get to know about many important things in the city. Be it : Fun Facts, Climate, Culture, Restaurants, Hangout Places, Monuments (if any), Shopping Complexes; Travel Mate has all. The user interface of the platform is kept fun and colorful in order to keep the user engaged in the app. Obviously, people travel with their friends, so we have share option at each step, by which everyone can share the all the facts amongst themselves.

Next comes the mode of transit. Compare the bus, trains and car travel prices from the platform itself. We have comprehensive list of various modes of transit sorted in the decreasing order of their user-rating. For car, we let the user know about the total toll taxes and the total cost of fuel he has to bear.

In pipeline, next, is shopping and searching for a suitable accomodation. Get the details of hotel from the app. Also, we need a checklist because remembering everything required for your perfect trip is quite cumbersome.

###2.Travel Phase
Next phase is the phase in which you are travelling to your destination. Here we try to detect the mood of the user.

####Mood Detection
We try to find the current state of mind or the mood of our traveller on the basis of his activity and selections on the app and hence recommend him books and songs accordingly, **using Machine Learning**. The user interface of the app also changes according to traveller’s mood to make him comfortable.

A very interesting feature of this app is - **Push notification** in between the journey. Often it happens that while travelling alone, a person tends to doze off. Push notification (alarm notification) feature saves the traveller from missing out the destination station.

###3.Trip Phase
While travelling in the destination city, user usually doesn't know much about the nearby location. We provide the users with real time details about the nearby places, monuments, restaurants, hotels (so that, he can also take a detuor) and medical centres.
